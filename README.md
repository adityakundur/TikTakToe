How to Play

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid displayed on the webpage.
Player 1 starts the game by clicking on an empty cell in the grid to mark it with an X.
Player 2 follows by clicking on another empty cell to mark it with an O.
Players alternate turns until one player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until all cells are filled, resulting in a draw.
Use the "Start New Game" button to reset the board and start a new round.
